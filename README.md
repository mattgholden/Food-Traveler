# Food-Traveler

### Your project idea 
 I will be creating an application called _Food Traveler_, that allows users to plan where to eat while they travel. My idea is to allow users to log in and enter the country and/or city they plan to travel to then display a map with popular restaurants. The users can create a "To Eat List" then add the restaurants they prefer to the list.  Once the list is created users can add, make updates, or delete.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mapbox || Google Maps

### List of backend models and their properties
**Users**
- Username/email
- Password

**Restaurants**
- Name
- Location/city

**ToEatList**
- Destination
- Date(s) of Travel
- Restaurant Name
- Days

### React component hierarchy (if applicable)
- Login
- Register
- Welcome/Landing
- Map
- NewToEatList
- EditToEatList

### User stories

- As a user, I should be able to register an account
- As a user, I should be able to log in and logout
- As a user, I should be able to view a map of popular restaurants in the city/country/location I am traveling to.
- As a user, I should be able to create a "To Eat" list, view the list, update the list, and delete the list.

### Anything else your squad lead should know
Stretch: I would like to try to use multer or cloudinary and maybe add a feature so when a restaurant is clicked it populates the ToEat List.
